# TODO List
- [ ] Add React project and integrate it with TypeScript.
- [ ] Introduce WebPack and connect it with React and TypeScript.
- [ ] Mimic the index page of https://tekstika.ee/, demo version. For demo, it does not communicate with the server so the frontend can complete it. (try not to see my original codes as much as possible).
